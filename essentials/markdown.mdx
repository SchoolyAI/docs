## Titles

Best used for section headers in your SchoolyAI documentation.

```md
## API Authentication
```

### Subtitles

Best used for subsection headers like endpoint groups or feature explanations.

```md
### Student Management Endpoints
```

<Tip>

Each **title** and **subtitle** creates an anchor and also shows up on the table of contents on the right, making it easy for users to navigate your SchoolyAI documentation.

## Text Formatting

We support most markdown formatting. Simply add `**`, `_`, or `~` around text to format it.

| Style         | How to write it   | Result          |
| ------------- | ----------------- | --------------- |
| Bold          | `**bold**`        | **bold**        |
| Italic        | `_italic_`        | _italic_        |
| Strikethrough | `~strikethrough~` | ~strikethrough~ |

You can combine these. For example, write `**_bold and italic_**` to get **_bold and italic_** text.

You need to use HTML to write superscript and subscript text. That is, add `<sup>` or `<sub>` around your text.

| Text Size   | How to write it          | Result                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Superscript | `<sup>superscript</sup>` | <sup>superscript</sup> |
| Subscript   | `<sub>subscript</sub>`   | <sub>subscript</sub>   |

## Linking to Pages

You can add a link by wrapping text in `[]()`. For example, `[SchoolyAI API](https://api.schoolyai.com)` links to [SchoolyAI API](https://api.schoolyai.com).

Links to pages in your docs need to be root-relative. For example, `[API Reference](/api-reference/introduction)` links to the API introduction page.

Relative links like `[link to text](../text)` will open slower because we cannot optimize them as easily.

## Code Examples

### API Requests

Use code blocks to show API examples:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.schoolyai.com/v1/students" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### JavaScript SDK

```javascript
import { SchoolyAI } from '@schoolyai/sdk';

const client = new SchoolyAI('YOUR_API_KEY');
const students = await client.students.list();
```

### Python SDK

```python
from schoolyai import SchoolyAI

client = SchoolyAI('YOUR_API_KEY')
students = client.students.list()
```

## Blockquotes

### Singleline

To create a blockquote, add a `>` in front of a paragraph.

> SchoolyAI's AI-powered learning algorithms adapt to each student's unique learning style and pace.

```md
> SchoolyAI's AI-powered learning algorithms adapt to each student's unique learning style and pace.
```

### Multiline

> SchoolyAI's AI-powered learning algorithms adapt to each student's unique learning style and pace.
>
> Our platform provides real-time feedback and personalized recommendations to optimize the learning experience.

```md
> SchoolyAI's AI-powered learning algorithms adapt to each student's unique learning style and pace.

```

## Tables

Use tables to organize information like API parameters or feature comparisons:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `student_id` | string | Yes | Unique identifier for the student |
| `course_id` | string | Yes | Unique identifier for the course |
| `progress` | number | No | Completion percentage (0-100) |

## Mathematical Expressions

SchoolyAI supports [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org) through the Latex component for mathematical content.

<Latex>P(learning\_improvement) = \frac{AI\_assistance + student\_effort}{total\_time}</Latex>

```md
<Latex>P(learning\_improvement) = \frac{AI\_assistance + student\_effort}{total\_time}</Latex>
```

## Best Practices for SchoolyAI Documentation

1. **Use clear, descriptive titles** that reflect the content
2. **Include code examples** for all API endpoints
3. **Add error handling examples** to help developers
4. **Use consistent formatting** throughout your documentation
5. **Include real-world use cases** and scenarios
6. **Link related content** to help users navigate
7. **Use tables** to organize complex information
8. **Include tips and warnings** where appropriate
