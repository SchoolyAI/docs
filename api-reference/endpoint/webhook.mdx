  "student_id": "std_123456789",

```

## Example Response

Your webhook endpoint should return a 200 status code to acknowledge receipt:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Webhook received successfully"
}
```

## Event Types

### lesson_completed
Triggered when a student finishes a lesson:
- Includes lesson details and performance metrics
- Contains time spent and accuracy information

### quiz_passed
Triggered when a student passes a quiz:
- Includes quiz results and score breakdown
- Contains detailed answer analysis

### course_started
Triggered when a student begins a new course:
- Includes course information and learning path
- Contains initial assessment results

### milestone_reached
Triggered when a student reaches a learning milestone:
- Includes milestone details and achievements
- Contains progress summary and next steps

## Error Handling

If your webhook endpoint returns an error (4xx or 5xx status code), SchoolyAI will retry the webhook delivery:

- **First retry**: 1 minute after initial failure
- **Second retry**: 5 minutes after first retry
- **Third retry**: 15 minutes after second retry
- **Final retry**: 1 hour after third retry

After 4 failed attempts, the webhook will be marked as failed and you'll need to manually review the issue.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Verify the webhook signature** to ensure authenticity
2. **Use HTTPS** for your webhook endpoint
3. **Implement idempotency** to handle duplicate webhook deliveries
4. **Process webhooks asynchronously** to avoid timeouts
5. **Log webhook events** for debugging and auditing

## Testing Webhooks

You can test your webhook endpoint using the SchoolyAI dashboard or by sending test payloads manually. The test payloads will have `event_type` set to `test_event`.
